Welcome to my quizz application. 
I set up this little QUIZZ in order to work on the arrays and improve the use of classes ! 


## programming language

This quizz was made with javascript, HTML and CSS. 

### How it works 

The quiz is composed of 30 questions, each question has 4 choices. 
You must answer a question to move on to the next one. 
Once all the questions have been answered the score appears with the number of wrong answers. 

For more fun you can choose a color mode. 
The default mode is grey. 
The other modes are black, purple and pink.
